            <p>The implementation of the circular economy (CE) in the construction industry has become a feasible solution 
              for achieving sustainable development while reducing environmental impact. 
              It is essential to systematically monitor, manage, and evaluate circularity 
              within the construction industry based on the needs and interests of stakeholders, 
              as this can provide evidence for circular practices. 
              However, the integration of CE increases complexities in the stakeholder network of the construction industry. 
              Many stakeholders lack clarity about their roles, requirements, and aspirations in circular projects, 
              leading to ineffective, hesitant, and ambiguous utilization of various circular measurement methods. 
              To address those problems, this paper adopts a systematic literature review approach 
              to conduct a comprehensive and critical review of measuring circularity from a stakeholder perspective. 
              The paper categorizes stakeholders into 7 key groups and identifies their needs and dilemmas at specific stages of the circular project life cycle. 
              Additionally, this study reviews the current development of circularity measurements 
              at different stages of the circular project life cycle and discusses how well they align with stakeholders' needs and dilemmas. 
              Finally, this study finds that there have been various attempts, 
              but several essential prerequisites for comprehensive measurement are missing or incomplete. 
              Several recommendations for measuring circularity that align more closely with stakeholder needs and address their current dilemmas are proposed. 
              These findings are intended to enhance the evaluation, regulation, and oversight of CE in the construction industry, 
              as well as to promote CE implementation.</p>

            <p>The rationality and safety of Urban Underground Space (UUS) construction are critical aspects of urban development. 
              Given the lack of safety concern of the surrounding environment in existing layout planning research for newly constructed UUS, 
              this study proposed a novel resilience evaluation model for UUS safe development through the cross-application of geotechnical analysis, 
              urban planning theory, and artificial intelligence (AI). 
              By re-using geological information, 
              the proposed model mapping algorithm enables the application of geological models to refined numerical calculations 
              which can accurately locate the range of excavation disturbances of new UUS. 
              Subsequently, the proposed AI algorithm is trained to learn from the existing UUS excavation cases, 
              establishing a mathematical mapping relationship between the main construction parameters of UUS and the safety indexes of surrounding affected buildings.
               The mapping relationship enables the assessment of the development resilience of UUS in the planned area through 
               the safety evaluation of surrounding affected buildings. Finally, the layout of an underground station for Nanjing Metro Line 13 is used, 
               as an example, to apply the proposed intelligent model. 
               This study contributes to the tools and methods for UUS layout evaluation from a safety perspective, 
               and seeks the breakthrough for the cross-application of geotechnical science and urban planning theory.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the vulnerability of cities has heightened the threat of disasters, 
              thereby endangering the safety of urban population. To mitigate these risks, 
              the establishment of well-planned shelter system is of utmost importance for effective emergency response. 
              Urban underground space (UUS) stands out as a promising solution for providing shelter during times of disasters, 
              owing to its distinct characteristics of confinement and stability. 
              However, the majority of UUS do not function directly for emergency evacuation, 
              leading to neglect at the planning phase. 
              It is valuable to study an applicable planning technique to prospectively consider emergency shelter services of UUS. 
              In this paper, based on digital tools, 
              a method for the rapid quantitative extraction and analysis of a dynamic population distribution 
              is proposed to quantify demand for emergency evacuation. 
              A multi-step greedy algorithm and a social force model (SFM) with specialized parameters 
              are constructed to realize the simulation and analysis on a digital platform with integrated urban models. 
              A multi-criteria decision-making system for evaluating UUS layout is established 
              using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). 
              Finally, a case study in Nanjing built-up area is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. 
              The proposed method can expand the research perspective and data-driven toolkit for underground space planning.</p>

        <p>The circular economy (CE) has brought new vitality to the construction industry, 
          and reverse logistics of construction waste has become an important way to circular practices. 
          However, the value chain in construction disposal waste management (CDWM) is too long, 
          and CDWM involves too many facilities, processes, and stakeholders. 
          Many issues have arisen in the logistics of CDWM, such as unreasonable facility allocation, 
          repeated transportation processes, and high empty load rates, resulting in secondary waste. 
          Therefore, this study aims to identify the enablers and obstacles of CDWM in the Hong Kong construction industry 
          and propose a decision framework to promote the efficiency of CDWM and implement the concept of CE.
          </p>
        <p>This study first conducted a content analysis of the current literature on CDWM research 
          and identified the current enablers and obstacles in CDWM in Hong Kong. 
          The study found that although the Hong Kong government has several recycling policies, supports and initiatives 
          for infrastructure network construction and logistics management, no single enabler can be effectively implemented in the application. 
          In addition, due to obstacles such as the limited land, shortage of recycling facilities and lack of recycling functions in Hong Kong, 
          CDWM needs clearer strategic guidance.</p>
        <p>These problems are also reflected in the data analysis of CDW logistics records provided by the Hong Kong government. 
          Therefore, this study combines the above content with the results of big data analysis to propose three management strategies: 
          1) Effective utilization of vehicle capacity; 2) The improvement in the recycling rate; 
          3) The avoidance of peak hours for waste collection and transportation. Based on the above three strategies, 
          the multi-objective value stream mapping evaluation method (i.e., time, cost, environmental emission, transportation efficiency) 
          was revised and improved. 
          Specifically, it is reflected in the correction of various value calculation formulas through the integration of several specific conditions, 
          such as trucks with different capacities and actual transport loads, and the processing processes of facilities under different operating periods. 
          A heatmap of each value under each specific improvement strategy is given for visualisation of decision making, 
          and a CDWM management decision-making method for optimizing multiple values is proposed 
          by combining the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method.</p>
          <p>Finally, this study combined the CDW logistics big data provided by the Hong Kong government and applied the framework to a case study 
            in Tuen Mun, Hong Kong. 
            This method provides decision-makers with a new CDW logistics management tool 
            and helps further implement the transformation of Hong Kong's construction industry to the CE.</p>

        <p><em>Background:</em> In previous research, 
          improving family caregivers' quality of life (QoL) positively impacts overall home care and thus improves ALS patients' QoL [1].
           Therefore, identifying the modifiable factors related to caregivers' QoL from aspects 
           such as family environment and clinical characteristics can guide interventions to improve overall home care in ALS.
          </p>
        <p><em>Objectives:</em> To examine the quality of life in family caregivers of ALS patients in China (n=101) and to analyse correlations with demographic, 
          clinical and family environmental factors related to caregivers and patients.</p>
        <p><em>Methods:</em> Quality of life was measured with care-related quality of life (CarerQoL) [2]. 
          In addition to obtaining basic demographic data, 
          the survey also obtained caring data such as time from receiving care of patients and frequency of nighttime caring time. 
          Sleep quality of both caregivers and patients was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [3]. 
          Patient's clinical characteristics were obtained with the MITOS staging system [4], 
          ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised-self-explanatory (ALSFRS-R-SE) [5], 
          disease duration and time from onset. Family environmental characteristics were investigated by questions related to home alteration, 
          whether other family members live together and their living status.</p>
          <p><em>Results:</em> Results will be presented at the International Symposium on ALS.</p>
          <p><em>Discussions:</em> We expect the findings to contribute to a better understanding 
            of which modifiable factors can improve family caregivers' QoL 
            and how we may provide interventions based on these factors to support them and then improve overall home care in ALS.</p>

        <p>Circularity measurements (CM) in the construction sector are diverse and complex. 
          Due to stakeholders' unclear understanding of their roles and demands in circular projects, 
          they may ineffectively, hesitantly, or ambiguously use various measurement methods. 
          Therefore, 
          the study comprehensively analysed the current research status of CM in the construction sector by clarifying and discussing stakeholders' involvement 
          and their dilemmas. 
          This study identified stakeholders in 7 key groups and their dilemmas at different stages of the circular construction life cycle (CCLC). 
          The CM at each stage of CCLC were critically analysed to understand whether they reflect stakeholders' dilemmas. 
          Finally, this study discussed and proposed several recommendations for measuring circularity. 
          The findings aim to enhance the assessment, regulation and monitoring of circular economy practices in the construction sector.</p>

        <p>The impact of complex geology on engineering excavations in modern urban construction is a topic 
          of great interest, and modelling is a critical tool for assessing this impact. Despite the availability of information 
          modelling tools for storing geological information and refined numerical analysis software, coupling these two 
          types of tools to build computational models that effectively analyze the impact of geological information on 
          engineering excavations remains challenging. This often results in critical geological information being 
          underutilized or overlooked in the simplified process of adapting computational time and resources. This study 
          proposes a model mapping algorithm based on the interpolation framework of numerical manifold method 
          (NMM) that can seamlessly integrate complex geological information from a 3D geological model established 
          by borehole big data into the numerical calculation. The algorithm's robustness is examined in terms of the 
          spatial distribution mapping of strata and the abrupt distribution mapping of mechanical parameters. The study 
          then discusses the influence of spatial variability of geotechnical property on the spatial effects of excavation, 
          and verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm by comparing it with actual engineering monitoring data. The 
          proposed algorithm can provide a refined numerical service for pre-planning underground spaces and for safety 
          assessments during construction, effectively assessing the impact of complex geology on engineering 
          excavations.</p>
